# 3D_Music_Box
Converts midi files into musical g-code which enables you to play tunes on your 3D printer.

To compose your own tunes, copy and rename the file "Music Box Template.mscz" in the scores folder. Open your renamed copy in Musescore 3 and get to work. When you finish composing, export your tune as a midi file.

Run music_box.py on your midi file, and (assuming your settings are correct in gcode_maker.py) the resultant gcode file should play the music!
